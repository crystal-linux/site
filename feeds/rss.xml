			<description>This project has recieved quite a bit of formalization today. Jnats has taken the role as the project lead, to resolve ties in votes among contributers or communicate with other companies/foundations. Ame (or amethyst) our in-house packaging tool, has recently been redone in rust and is now feature-complete with the python version. There will also be a meetingbetween the main members on Sunday at 1pm EST every week in our discord server. The newsletter willcome out shortly after the meeting.
