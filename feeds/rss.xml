            	<description>All packages in the crystal (no longer CrystalUX!) repos will from now on be signed using PGP keys, this will require the crystal-keyring package to be installed. The Testingbranch will also return, as well as a new Developer branch, which will be even more bleeding edge and might be more broken. Ame will soon also be getting an audit for the codebase, to provide a smootjer experience. Citrine now has a final plan we will be following, it will be getting LVM on LUKS support by next week. Citrine will also be moving to a TUI interface, instead of CLI. Our getting started app "Opal" is now also in the plannings and will soon be picked up in development.

		<description>This project has recieved quite a bit of formalization today. Jnats has taken the role as the project lead, to resolve ties in votes among contributers or communicate with other companies/foundations. Ame (or amethyst) our in-house packaging tool, has recently been redone in rust and is now feature-complete with the python version. There will also be a meetingbetween the main members on Sunday at 1pm EST every week in our discord server. The newsletter willcome out shortly after the meeting.
