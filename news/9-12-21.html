            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hello again! You may have noticed the project may seem a lot more active in the past week or so than usual. That's because it has been. In today's meeting (as of writing this), We've went out and discussed our plans for the road ahead, and what we want to achieve before System76 updates our planned flagship distro, COSMIC (which should be around October.)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="subcontentheader">
                The Crystal (no longer CrystalUX!) Repositories
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>As of today, we've started signing packages with our PGP keys (and as such, you'll have to install the crystal-keyring package to install them.)</li>
                <li>However, this should not be much of an issue as not many people actually use Crystal yet. But I digress, this process still needs to be sorted out fully, and integrated into the ISO. Expect this to be sorted out by next weekly meeting (19th September, 2021)</li>
                <li>We're also going to be bringing back the Testing branch of the repositories, and adding a new Developer Branch. The Developer branch will have the newest, and most broken packages. Once some surface-level testing and patching has been done, these will be pushed to the Testing repo. Once they've been sufficiently stress-tested, they'll be pushed to Main. We do not advise anyone outside of the Dev team to use the Developer repo, but feel free to if you feel like you could help in contributing or preliminary testing of packages.
            </ul>
            <h3 class="subcontentheader">
                Ame (again)
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Another thing we plan to do within the next week or so is to sufficiently run through and audit Ame. Hopefully by the end, ame should be an overall smoother experience.</li>
                <li>Part of this ame audit will also be to improve the user experience and flesh out the --help page a bit more. Again, expect this sooner than later.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="subcontentheader">
                Citrine
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Citrine has been a point of contention within our group, and we've been debating about what exactly we want to do with it and which direction we want it to go. At one point, we even considered forking the Void Linux installer for ours.</li>
                <li>I am glad to announce, however, that we finally do have a proper plan and roadmap for Citrine.</li>
                <li>Currently, I plan on getting LVM on LUKS (full disk encryption) support as an option in the installer by next week. After that and after some heavy runthroughs, we plan to start gradually moving Citrine to a TUI installer, rather than a CLI one.</li>
                <li>Once that is done, we could potentially in the future also branch out to a GUI-based installer, but that is still to be decided.</li>
             </ul>
            <h3 class="subcontentheader">
                Opal (Getting Started)
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Another thing we plan to sort out is Opal, our "Getting Started" app. It'll open only once, upon first boot and will run you through basic things, like pointing you to helpful Linux resources, or helping you quickly install common/useful packages. We plan to do this using Glade and in Python. Of course, any help and contribution is greatly appreciated.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="subcontentheader">
                Wrapping Up
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To conclude today's weekly meeting. We're focusing on a few things mainly over the next few weeks: Stability, Efficiency, Security and Usability. These are, and will always be the main focuses of Crystal Linux. And so, like that, we conclidue this weekly meeting, see you next week, and look out for great things up ahead!</li>
