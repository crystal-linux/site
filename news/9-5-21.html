            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hello there. This project has recieved quite a bit of a formalization today. Hopefully I'll do it justice for this week.</li>
            </ul>

                Project Governance
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>jnats has assumed the role of project lead, to break ties in votes among contributors, and to communicate with the SPI organization and it's employees.</li>
                <li>Additionally, we've decided that we'll publish these weekly updates, which in the future will also contain more in-depth notes from project maintainers in regards to what has changed in their areas.</li>
                <li>These updates will usually be written by jasio, not matt.</li>
            </ul>

                AME
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>AME (or amethyst), our in-house package tool, has recently been re-written in rust. Unfortunately, as of the time I'm writing this, it has some issues</li>
                <li>The rewrite is complete, and it's feature-complete with the Python version, but the new features have been inducing bugs.</li>
                <li>By the time anybody reads this, though, I suspect axtlos (main developer) will have pushed a commit in a hurry</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="subcontentheader">
                The Website
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Since I (Matt) wanted to get us started on the weekly updates, I threw together this new site layout based on my own personal website (sorry!). I hope it'll be workable for the rest of the developers, though. I certainly do want feedback!</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="subcontentheader">
                Other Notes
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We've decided that at least for now, before these weekly posts go out, the main members will have a chat at 1pm EST on Sunday. (With the hope the letter goes out later that night)</li>
                <li>These voice chats will take place on Discord, at least for now. Feel free to listen in! (Link on homepage)</li>
